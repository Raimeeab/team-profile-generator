## üìù Description
This app generates a webage that displays your team project's basic information, with links to their emails, GitHub profiles and other relevant information using a command-line application. This project has taught me how to implement unit testing to ensure that the codes functionality is operating correctly. 

<a name="technologies"></a>
## üïπ Technologies used 

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Inquirer
- Jest Unit Testing

<a name="installation"></a>
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation 
*You can find a step-by-step tutorial [here](https://github.com/Raimeeab/team-profile-generator/blob/main/dist/demos/Walkthrough.mov)*

1. Git clone this repository onto your local machine and navigate to the file on your terminal. *This can also be done by opening the file on Visual Studios and running it through the intergated terminal.*

![git-clone](./dist/demos/git-clone.gif)

2. In order for the app to function correctly, ensure you have the latest or most stable version of Node.js and that you've run:

    - `npm install`

![install](./dist/demos/install.gif)

3. Run `node index.js` and follow the prompts that run on your terminal. This will then generate your very own README file for your project.

## üñ• Usage 
Follow the installation steps above to generate your webpage by entering the required information through the command-line terminal. 
- If you wish to do multiple webpages, please keep in mind that the file will overwrite itself if the file name is the same. The default name is "index.html".
- If you do not have all the information needed at the time of creating the app, simply keep those prompts empty and add them directly in your HTML file at a later time. 

<a name="testing"></a>
## üéõ Testing
Use Unit Testing with Jest: 
- Run `npm run test` in your terminal
